## Prediction Analysis on Heart Disease Case

### Introduction

Heart disease refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart’s structure and function, leading to various cardiovascular problems. The term ‘heart disease’ is often used interchangeably with ‘cardiovascular disease’ or coronary heart disease’. In 2019, cardiovascular disease accounted for approximately 17.9 million deaths, representing 32% of the all-global deaths. Heart disease is the major contributor to this figure. 

### Aim and Objectives

The goal of this project is to determine 

•	Understand the dataset and clean up (if required)

•	Relationship between the features / Exploratory Analysis

•	Build classification models to predict whether or not the patients have heart disease.
